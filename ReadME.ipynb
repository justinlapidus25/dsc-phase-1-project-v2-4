    "The Task:\n",
    "Watching as the competition has grown with the emergence of streaming and pandemic downtime, Microsoft has been tasked with seeing if funding a new movie studio would be financially stimulating. In order to reach this conclusion, Microsft wants Data Scientists to analyze trends seen in other studios to determine what method would result in the greatest gross profit. In order to have a direction to proceed Microsoft would like to know what genres would be successful, what studios have earned to most income, as well as what runtime produces the best overall movies for Microsoft.\n",

    "Data:\n",

    "Rotten Tomatoes: Rotten Tomatoes and the Tomatometer score are the world's most trusted recommendation resources for quality entertainment. As the leading online aggregator of movie and TV show reviews from critics, we provide fans with a comprehensive guide to what's Fresh – and what's Rotten – in theaters and at home.\n",
